I want to learn to program. Should I begin with C; C++; Java; or Python? And why?
Before embarking on a programming language learning journey, the first thing to think of is your motivation.

Depending on the career track you want to choose, your choices will vary. If you wish to pursue a career in traditional software engineering, beginning with C, C++ or Java is probably your best bet, as they are often used in industry and have tons of learning resources about them.

However, if you want to break into data science or data analytics, your best bet would be to start with Python, as it's one of the defacto programming languages for working with data. The added benefit here is that Python is simpler than C, C++, or Java and that the barrier to entry is much lower in data science and Python. Python contains various tools and packages for working with data, from data manipulation packages like pandas to data visualization packages such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, finally to machine learning packages such as scikit-learn, and more.

R is also another alternative to learning data science. It is the only popular alternative to Python in data science and most commonly used in research and development, statistical analysis, data analysis, and dashboard creation. One of its main killer apps is shiny, which lets you easily create web-based dashboards to report and communicate data.

If you're interested in pursuing a learning path for R and Python, we highly recommend you check out these articles on how to learn R and Python, respectively. Moreover, we encourage you to check out our Data Scientist in Python, and Data Scientist in R career tracks, which contain up to 30 courses and projects each that allow you to learn and apply your skills by coding right in the browser.

(Music) Internet websites offer lots of different

services, one of the most popular being online shopping. When you explore an online shopping website,

navigating through pages, choosing different product categories, or comparing products,

you are interacting with the front-end of a website. Let us see how the front-end of a website

is developed by front-end developers. For this, we need to understand how a website

is made. To create a website, web developers usually

use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. These languages

are designed to work in conjunction with each other. HTML is used to create the physical structure

of a website. The physical structure contains elements such

as text, links, images/videos, page dividers and buttons. The HTML code ensures a proper formatting

of all text and image elements so that browsers display the page consistently. The backend developer codes the structure

of the website. A website is like a house which has only been

constructed. Just like we need interior designers to add

style to a space, we need front-end developers to add the necessary glamor and appeal to

a website. When you order products from any website,

you realize that the pages have a pleasing font, attractive colors, and are easy

to navigate. Developers use CSS to create stylish websites. CSS provides front-end developers with a standard

method to define, apply, and manage different sets of style characteristics for a website

and each of its components. CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style,

colors, fonts, designs and layouts. So, HTML is used to create the structure and

CSS is used to design it and make it appealing. CSS is also used to create websites that have

cross browser compatibility which means that they are compatible with multiple browsers

and multiple devices such as PC, mobile devices, iPads etc. Online shopping websites are intuitive,

interactive and quick to load. This is where JavaScript comes into the picture. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming

language that is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add interactivity to a website. For example, you use HTML to add a login button

to a page, and CSS to style that button. You then use JavaScript to add log-in functionality

to that button. A new front-end development language is Syntactically

Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) called SAAS. It is an extension of CSS that is compatible

with all versions of CSS. SASS enables you to use things like variables,

nested rules, and inline imports to keep things organized. SAAS allows you to create style sheets faster

and more easily. Another language that is being used now is

Learner Style Sheets (LESS) or LESS. LESS enhances CSS, adding more styles and

functions. It is backwards compatible with CSS. Less.js is a JavaScript tool that converts

the LESS styles to CSS styles. Using all these languages, websites are designed

as reactive and responsive. Reactive or adaptive websites display the

version of the website designed for a specific screen size. For example, a website can provide more information

if opened on a PC than when opened on a mobile device. Responsive design of a website means that

it will automatically resize to the device it is being accessed from. For example, if you open up a products website

on your mobile device, it will adapt itself to the small size of the screen and still

show you all the features. A JavaScript framework is an application framework

that is written in JavaScript. Programmers can manipulate the different functions,

use them wherever required and can create device responsive applications. A few examples of several frameworks being

used are: Angular framework: an open-source framework

and is being maintained by Google. Angular frameworks allow websites to render

the HTML pages quickly and efficiently. It has built-in tools for routing and form

validation. React.js has been developed and maintained

by Facebook. It is a JavaScript library that builds and

renders components for a web page. It is not a complete suite of tools. For example, routing is not a part of this

framework and will need to be added using a third-party tool. React.js only helps build and drop components

into a page. Vue.js is maintained by the community and

its main focus is the view layer which includes user interface, buttons, and visual components. It is flexible, scalable and integrates well

with other frameworks. It is very adaptable. It can be a library,

or it can be the framework. The task of a front-end developer evolves

continuously. The technologies are upgraded constantly and

so front-end developers needs to keep upgrading the websites that they create. The websites that they create should work

in multiple browsers, multiple operating systems and multiple devices.

 

(Music) Welcome to Introducing Application Development

Tools. Getting your Cloud App from the ideas stage

to fully formed, written, and deployed is a long process, but there are many tools which

will help you along the way. A cloud application developer’s workbench

includes: Version Control, Libraries, and Frameworks. When many developers are working on the same

project, knowing what order changes were made, thereby creating a new version of the source code,

becomes overridingly important. Version control systems keep track of what

changes were made when and by whom and resolve any conflicts between changes. For developing your code, version control can

be useful even when you are the sole contributor on a project. Properly used, it can give you a way to revert

to an older version of your code if something goes wrong and gives you some basic information

about how the code developed over time. Version control functionality is generally

tied to the storage system you are using, which is why a code repository is recommended,

even for beginners. Git and GitHub are extremely popular for source

code storage and management. Git stores files in repositories where you

can track changes, split code into different branches for more focused development, and

then merge them back into the main body of code. Libraries are collections of code, like standard

programs and subroutines, that you can use within your code. For example, you might want to include a navigational

feature, like a carousel. A code library can supply you with the code for that so that

you don’t have to spend the time and energy creating one from scratch. Being able to reuse code in this way makes

developing your app much quicker and easier. Multiple code libraries can be integrated

into your existing project. As you discover a need for a specific function

or feature, you can research an appropriate library. You determine when to call the required method

as needed, and control returns to the program flow once the subroutine is finished. When you use a code library, you are in control. Code libraries are generally used to solve

a specific problem or add a specific feature set. Either way, there are lots for you to choose

from, so do your research. Here are some examples of code libraries: jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies

Dom manipulation. Email-validator is a small library that checks

an email address is correctly constructed and valid. Apache Commons Proper is a repository of reusable

Java components. Frameworks provide a standard way to build

and deploy applications. You can think of a framework as being a skeleton

that you can extend by adding your own code, providing a scaffold on which to build your

apps. The framework you intend to use must be determined

early in your development planning and used right from the beginning. New frameworks can’t be incorporated into

an existing project. Your chosen framework dictates the architecture

of your program and controls the program flow. The framework determines which subroutines

and methods will be called when. When working with a framework, there is a specific structure

that you must follow. The framework is calls on your code,

rather than you calling on the framework. Frameworks are less flexible than libraries,

allowing you less control, but they do provide good standardization and can help you create

efficient code. To use an analogy, if you are a carpenter

building a house, the framework is the frame that you add to – bricks on the outside,

plasterboard on the inside, and so on. The frame acts as a guide for how the house

is constructed. Here are some examples of frameworks. AngularJS is a JavaScript-based framework

for dynamic web applications. Vue.js is a JavaScript framework focused on

the user interface. Django is a framework that uses Python for

web development. Frameworks define the workflow that you must

follow, unlike libraries, which allow you to call functions as and when required. When using a framework, it can sometimes feel

like you, as a developer, are not in full control of the development process. This sense of the framework and its predefined

workflow controlling the development process is referred to as inversion of control. Frameworks that have a lot of control are

known as opinionated – they have opinions on how their workflow should be used and remove

a lot of the decisions you would otherwise have to make about how code is written, the

location of files, and even file names. Frameworks often include their own libraries,

which they call when needed. Inversion of control allows you to create

standardized apps, and takes away a lot of the tedious configuration work, so you can

focus on the code for your app. In this video, you’ve learned about some

of the tools that you will utilize in your career as a developer including: Version control, libraries, frameworks

 

(Music) Welcome to More Application Development Tools. Let’s look at some tools which can help

you get your app built and deployed: CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages, and Package Managers. CI/CD refers to the practices of continuous

integration and either continuous delivery or continuous deployment. CI/CD is a best practice for devops teams

enabling developers to deliver frequent changes reliably. Implemented through a build-automation server,

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that all the code components work together smoothly. A CI build environment enables you to integrate

newly developed code frequently, at least every day, if not every hour, depending on

how quickly the project changes. Continuous delivery (CD) begins where CI ends.

The CI process automatically builds and tests your code, then CD deploys all code changes

in a build to a testing or staging environment. A build tool transforms your source code into

the binaries needed for installation. Build tools organize your source code, set

compile flags, and manage dependencies. They are most important in environments where

there are many inter-connected projects, with multiple developers contributing to each project. In these environments it can be very difficult

to keep track of what changes were made, in what order, what dependencies exist, and what

needs to be incorporated in the next build. So automation is key to keeping everything

running smoothly. Build automation can automate a wide variety

of tasks that developers do in their day-to-day activities like: Downloading dependencies. Compiling source code into binary code. Packaging that binary code. Running tests and deployment to production systems. You can initiate a build from the command

line or from an IDE. There are two categories of Build Tools widely

in use: Build-automation utilities, which generate

build artifacts like executables, by compiling and linking source code. Build-automation servers, which execute build-automation

utilities on a scheduled or triggered basis. Some examples of build tools are: Webpack – a module bundler for JavaScript and Babel – a JavaScript compiler. Now that you have your app developed and tested,

you’re ready to deploy. But how does that happen? The app needs to be simple and trouble free

for the user to install, so a commonly used technique is to collect all the necessary

files and bundle them together into a package. Packages are archive files that contain the

app files, instructions for installation, and any metadata that you choose. They have their own metadata too, including

the package description, package version, and any dependencies, like other packages

that need to be installed beforehand. Once you have bundled your app into a package,

you can use a package manager to distribute it. Package managers take care of the tasks of

finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling software packages at the user's request. Package management systems: Coordinate with file archivers to extract

package archives Verify checksums and digital certificates

to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the package Locate, download, install, or update existing

software from a software repository and manage dependencies to ensure a package is

installed with all packages it requires. Some commonly used package managers for each

of the major platforms are listed here: On Linux - Debian Package Management System

(DPKG) and Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) On Windows - Chocolatey On Android - Package Manager On MacOS - Homebrew and MacPorts Any libraries or utility code

that is developed as part of the application is managed with the cloud application package

managers. Here are some examples of package managers

for popular languages: for Node.js/Javascript - npm for Java - Gradle and Maven for Ruby - RubyGems for Python - Pip and Conda In this video you’ve learned about some

of the tools that you will utilize will support you in your career as a developer , including: CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages and Package Managers

 

(Music) Welcome to the importance of back-end development. A front-end developer creates websites and

Cloud applications, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create what the user sees and interacts

with in the client software. A back-end developer creates and manages all

the resources that are needed to respond to the requests that the user makes through the

client. The back-end developer’s tasks focus on

enabling the server infrastructure, or back-end, to process requests, supply data, and provide

other services securely. Front-end and back-end developers must work

together very closely. Each needs to understand the requirements

of the solution and how their respective parts will interact before the development process

can begin. Throughout the lifecycle of the website or

Cloud app, front-end and back-end developers collaborate to resolve issues and add functionality. How does the work of a back-end developer

affect you as you are browsing the internet or using a Cloud app? Think about it like this: when you’re shopping

online, what happens to the data you enter? Your login information, your product searches,

your payment info? The back-end processes all these things, and

the back-end developers write and maintain the parts of the application that process

the inputs. Let’s think about your experience as you

explore an online shopping site and make a purchase. As you search for products, your search request

is submitted to a web application which then retrieves the data from a separate database

and serves it back to the client for display. To facilitate this, a back-end developer must

understand the language that the web application uses, how to query the database for the correct

data, and how to bring the two together. Even a simple task like navigating around

the site can require the skills of a back-end developer. Many sites have restricted areas that are

only available to users who have an account and have logged in. User account management, authentication and

authorization can be the responsibility of the back-end developer too. Once you’ve decided what you want to purchase,

you must add it to your cart and make a payment. The purchase process requires you to submit

sensitive information, such as your address and credit card number, and the back-end developer

must ensure that this data is securely handled and stored. Front-end client interactions, whether a request

for data like an image, accepting input from a user filling out a form, or securing sensitive

information like a credit card number all require different services from the back-end

server. Each request needs to interact with the back-end

in a different way. Back-end developers use APIs, routes, and

endpoints to process incoming requests: An API is code that works with data, usually

using JSON or XML. APIs have set rules and structure. A route is a path to a website or page that

the user interacts with. Routes generally take user input and show

results based on the input. An endpoint may be an API or may simply be

a path. When a request from the front-end arrives

at the back-end, it is routed to the correct service. If the backend has an end point defined for

the request by using routing, the request will be addressed and replied to. If the end point is missing, the server returns

a 404 error. Back-end developers must create and maintain

this server-side routing. Along with backend APIs, routes effectively

allow the front-end client to plug into the correct socket at the back-end. APIs provide a mechanism for Cloud apps, mobile

apps, and other types of software to access resources from the back-end. To perform all this back-end development you

will need to be familiar with at least one back-end language, and its associated frameworks. Among the most popular languages today is

JavaScript, which was originally designed to run in web browsers, adding extra interactivity

and dynamic content to web pages. JavaScript is also being used on the back-end,

with new releases adding server-side functionality. JavaScript has many frameworks, but two of

the most well-known are Node.js and Express. Python is another popular language; it’s

very flexible and easy to learn. Python has wide functionality – it can be used for

everything from creating web pages to connecting to a database, to performing data analysis. Two well-known Python frameworks are Django

and Flask. Back-end developers often work with data and

databases, so you will also benefit from learning some SQL. To help handle requests from databases, back-end

developers can use object-relational mapping tools (ORM) to connect to the database and

retrieve the correct data. Although an ORM can hide some of the complexity

of querying databases, it’s useful to understand the fundamentals of databases so that you

can troubleshoot any issues that arise. The day-to-day tasks of a back-end developer

focus on the behind the scenes functionality that keeps websites, cloud apps and mobile

apps up and running. Back-end development covers a wide range of

technologies, from managing user accounts, authentication and authorization to ensuring

that sensitive data is stored and transferred securely. Back-end developers also work with databases,

retrieving , processing and storing data as required. Life for a back-end developer is varied, challenging,

and ever changing.
